## Basic Guidelines
* You may begin working as soon as the theme is announced.
* You will have exactly 4 hours from theme announcement to work.
* You must make *something* in this 4 hours. What that something is is up to you.
* You may work in teams or alone.
    * You are welcome to contribute to multiple projects (e.g. producing audio for multiple projects)

## Project Guidelines
* Your project doesn't have to explicitly follow the theme, the theme is there as a jumping off point if you don't have an idea to start with.
* Any and all assets are free game. You don't have to make everything in your project yourself.
* If you have any base-code you are starting from, you are encouraged to share it on 4hourjam.com before the jam starts, or include it in your project post.
* You are encouraged to open-source your project when possible.
* **Your project does not have to be software.**

## Post Jam
* You'll have ~5 minutes to present your project at the end of the jam.
* You must present what you made, complete or not.
* We suggest your presentation include the following:
	* How your project relates to the theme
	* A demo of your project, working or not
	* What went right/wrong
	* What you would change/do again
* You must post your results to 4hourjam.com
	* A (probably short) postmortem is encouraged as well. (see above presentation suggestions)
* You are welcome to improve your project post-jam, but you may not change the original project on 4hourjam.com, for record keeping purposes.
	* You are, however, encouraged to post your post-jam project to 4hourjam.com in the post-jam category.
